					<span>“With gates of silver and bars of gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have fenced my sheep from their father’s fold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have heard the dropping of their tears</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In heaven these eighteen hundred years.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O Lord and Master, not ours the guilt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We build but as our fathers built;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold thine images, how they stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sovereign and sole, through all our land.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Christ sought out an artisan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A low-browed, stunted, haggard man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a motherless girl, whose fingers thin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pushed from her faintly want and sin.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These set he in the midst of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as they drew back their garment-hem,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For fear of defilement, “Lo, here,” said he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The <em>images</em> ye have made of me!”</span>
